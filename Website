A Website to Write Stories.

Example: I want people to do anything they like as long as it isn’t extremely inappropriate. But other than that I want them to express and tell and show/make anything they love.

•Who:kids, to teens,s to even adults anyone but the target audience will be primarily teens they have more realistic yet still fun and interesting ideas. 

•What:it will be about all things related to creativity. Drawing and making their own stuff. Making stories and sharing and maybe even mash and help other users. 

• Why: Because I want them to find out what kinds of things they like and how to help them with it. Because like them I myself have a lot of imaginations and dreams like making my books or movies. It just intrigues me to no end. 

How: I intend to make a website which will take a long long time because i suck ass at even the basics of coding but basically take story writing websites and drawing along with making or editing their own posters and all that stuff.
